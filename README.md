ðŸ”‘ Library for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), used by [passepartui](https://github.com/kardwen/passepartui) and [Partout](https://github.com/kardwen/partout)

*This library is currently experimental.*

## Feature flags

* `gpg` Decryption with GnuPG (LibrePGP)
* `sq` Decryption with Sequoia PGP (OpenPGP)

Recently GnuPG parted from the OpenPGP standard, therefore I am experimenting with adding an implementation that can interact with a password store that stores file generated by sequoia-pgp. I named the CLI `passe` and added a feature flag for it.

For more details, please have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.rs/passepartout).

The name `passepartout` just means "master key" in French.

## Development

At the moment, only decryption operations are implemented, but I may add missing functionality as needed.

Notes:

* Set flag `--all-features` for cargo commands to activate all features of all packages
